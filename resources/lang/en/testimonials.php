		'quote'   => 'Ross is a good developer with heaps of potential and great team player. While he was here with us, he worked on a range of projects from payment integration with multiple providers to POS integration. He learnt new ideas quickly and was able to solve complex problems with the team. Ross was hired as a PHP developer but has shown aptitude in Android/Java and has made updates to our various Android apps as he saw issues. All in all a good guy who is only going to go from strength to strength. I wish him the best of luck in his future endeavours.',
